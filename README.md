Module 10 Weekly Challenge

Hello, 

For Module 10, I found the Flask components to be the most difficult part. Creating the static routes was relatively straight forward but I struggled a lot on the dynamic ones. 
For just the start date dynamic route, it took me quite a while to pull the data in the first place. I practiced with my queries in Jupyter Notebook so I could ensure I was able to even pull the data in the first place since I kept getting an error on the development server. I understand the logic in how to pull information from the database but struggle when that gets translated to dynamic inputs in Flask. I found the start and end dynamic route to be even more difficult. The code works when I test it in Jupyter Notebook but I get null when I run it in the development server. I think the null output has to do with either my filter or date formats. 

Thanks.
